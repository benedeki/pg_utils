CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pgutils.lock_mutex(

) RETURNS VOID AS

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Function: pgutils.lock_mutex(1)
-- Version:  0.1.0
--
--      The goal of this function is to implement concurrent operation execution - operation is given in the input
--      parameter.
--
--      Note: call this function at the beginning of an operation (usually a wider UPDATE/INSERT) that you want to
--          prevent concurrent execution of, and the release will happen automatically when the transaction finishes or
--          rolls back. This is because the table pgutils.active_mutexes is locked for the given operation.
--
-- Parameters:
--      i_mutex_name - Name of the operation that will perform the lock.
--
